					<h2>West African Peanut Soup</h2>
					<a href="http://cookieandkate.com/2013/west-african-peanut-soup/"><p>Recipe from Cookie &amp; Kate</p></a>
					<section>
						<p>Peanut soup is a great recipe for those lazy days when you just want to curl up on the couch in your pajamas and watch terrible TV. No shame, we've all been there. But peanut soup can be a real staple to your weekly meal plan.</p>
						<p>The best part of this dish is how simple it is to make. It uses ingredients you may already have in your pantry &mdash; "rainy day" ingredients, if you will &mdash; with the addition of fresh kale or collard greens, which usually don't cost more than $1.99 for a bundle.</p>
						<p>Plus there's the added benefit of it being totally vegan and filling, making it the perfect lunch or dinner, if you're looking to lose a few pounds without sacrificing flavor and feeling full.</p>
						<p>This dish can be served with a side of white rice (I prefer jasmine or basmati) or nice bread.</p>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/12/what-the-bravetart-ate-2016-favorite-recipes.html">Stella's Favorite Recipes of 2016</a> is a website similar to mine in that it shows Stella's favorite recipes and meals. Comparing to mine, this website is gorgeous, but that of course comes with the styling choices, which we aren't covering yet this week. But ultimately, the container where the content is featured in is thoughtful and the flow of the information itself is smooth. In contrast, my website right now is looking a little rough, but only because there's no styling in place. Without CSS, that Serious Eats website would look pretty similar to mine.</p>
